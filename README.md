# What risks do you see when designing such an application?

Cyberbullying/hate speech, misinformation, copyright infringements, illegal content, defamation, breaches of privacy/doxxing, discrimination, trolling, spam

Especially the anonymity may embolden users to angange in abovementioned abusive behaviour.

Ultimately the responsibility lies with the platform concerning illegal content etc. and it may be held accountable if no reasonable preventive measures were taken.

# How can you ensure that the application stays a safe space?

### Community Guidelines üìù
Have clear community guidelines, that not only state what content and behaviours in not accepted, but also encourage positive values like supportivness and mindfulness towards others, inclusive language, creating a safe(r) space together. Users need to agree to and accept these guidelines before posting content.

### Possiblity to report/flag problematic content üö©
Implement features so that users can report harmful or inappropriate content, and encourage them to do so.

### AI assisted filtering üíª
Filter content for text patterns to prevent doxxing/privacy breaches.

Natural Language processing tools, machine learning to identify and flag threats, hate speech..

Analyze use pattern to detect spam/trolling behaviour.

Image recognition to detect and flag inappropriate or offensive images, hate symbols.

These algorithms can be problematic in and of themselves; and depending on the training datasets might create false positives or replicate racial and gender bias.

### Moderation üïµÔ∏è
Have moderators to review content posted on the app (spot checks, and when flagged as per point 2 and 3) and take action if necessary (prevent publishing, remove content, ban users etc.).

### Trigger Warnings  ‚ö†Ô∏è
For discussing sensitive and potentially triggering topics (for example self-harm), encourage users to add trigger warnings to their posts and/or to use 'spoilers' formatting.

### Transparency üîç
Be transparent about the measures taken (for example in case content is filtered with algorithms, if use patterns are tracked etc.), no showdow-banning.

### Policies ‚öñÔ∏è
Have policies and an action plan on legal issues in place before an incident occurs.
